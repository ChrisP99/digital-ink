Amazon RDS service allows a user to create a fully-featured and highly-available SQL database that is automatically
replicated to another availability zone. (TODO: Oops, no multi-az) This means that if the primary database becomes
unavailable, there is automatic failover providing redundancy for all the data stored within.

To create an Amazon RDS instance, a suitable name/identifier for the database is required before created as well as a
selection for the resource limits for the virtual server.
The database requires a username and passphrase, although for additional security there is the option to automatically
generate a passphrase.

Afterwards, the type of SQL database required (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB or others) will be selected and then
the database should begin provisioning.
