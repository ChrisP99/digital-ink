\chapter{VPC and Subnets}\label{ch:vpc_subnets}

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows for AWS resources to be launched in a virtual network that has been custom
defined and configured.
This virtual network is similar to a traditional network which operates within your own physical data center, with the
added benefits of the scalable AWS infrastructure~\parencite{amazon2022what}.
A VPC can have multiple assigned subnets, which are a range of IP addresses accessible in the VPC\@.
