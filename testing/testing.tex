\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:testing}

This chapter of the report will detail the testing conducted on the configured AWS services.
This was done to determine the accuracy and efficiency of the configurations made during the deployment process.
We used
The testing was conducted by using Gherkin, a language used to define behaviour and test
cases~\parencite{dos2018automated}.
It is non-technical and is intended to be easily human-readable.
Gherkin uses set keywords for structure and meaning: Given, When, and Then.
An example of this structure can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gherkin}.

EC2, S3, CloudFront, RDS, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail were all tested using this approach.
Screenshots are included to illustrate the results of these tests.
