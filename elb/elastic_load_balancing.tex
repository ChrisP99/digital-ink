\chapter{Elastic Load Balancing}\label{ch:elastic-load-balancing}
Elastic Load Balancing is used to automatically scale your EC2 instances to meet any changes in demand from your users. ELB can be used to both scale up or down the instance's resources to ensure that your application is kept performant and available regardless of how many users visit. It is also possible to scale down the resources again, after the spike in usage has passed, to save money when it comes to billing and ensure you aren't paying for any additional resources that are not being used.
