\section{systemd Services}\label{sec:systemd-services}
\mintinline{zsh}|systemd| is a service manager, which is a program that launches and monitors different services across
the system.
The digital-ink application is automatically started upon boot by the systemd process, which ensures that the
application is started correctly and without errors.
If any errors occur, systemd will log them in a tool known as \mintinline{zsh}|journalctl| and then follow a
configuration file for instructions on how to handle those errors.
This can range from simply restarting a program that has errored, to trying once again, or recording the failure and
performing no action.
