This report details the process of designing, developing, and deploying a cloud application onto Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The application is called \textit{Digital Ink} and allows users to create, edit, and delete their own short stories.
Users can then view their own short stories and other users' short stories.
It was first developed locally using a LAMP stack.
This consisted of Linux - hosted through Docker - for the operating system, an Apache HTTP Server, MySQL for the relational database management, and PHP as the programming language.

After the application was built locally, it was gradually integrated onto AWS\@.
This involved implementing several AWS cloud features to enhance the application, ensure application security, and increase availability.
This was accomplished by using Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), ELB (Elastic Load Balancing), and more.
The process of implementing these cloud features will be discussed throughout the report.

After the application was integrated onto AWS, an evaluation of the process was conducted.
This includes a discussion of the security practices used, estimated costs for different user scales, and thorough testing.
Lastly, several enhancements which could be made to the application in the future will be discussed.
