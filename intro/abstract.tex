This report covers the local development and deployment of Digital-Ink - a website designed for users to read and share
short stories.
The rest of the report details the successful cloud deployment of the web app through AWS, by using services such as
VPCs, EC2, S3 buckets, RDS, ELB, and more.
The deployment was carried out with security and cost-effectiveness in mind.
The report ends by detailing potential future enhancements which could be made in future deployments of the web app.

This report was conducted in a group of three students - Adam Cordner, Christopher Perry, and Evie Snuggle - using
AWS accounts and credits provided by Birmingham City University.
The AWS service configuration and deployment was conducted together in person using Christopher's AWS account, and the
separate chapters of the documentation was split among us.
Adam primarily worked on documenting the web app, VPC, security practices, cost breakdown, and future enhancements.
Evie mainly recorded the use of S3, RDS, ELB, security practices, and future enhancements.
Christopher focused on detailing CloudFront, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, cost breakdown, and testing.
Additional editing was done on the report by Adam and Christopher.
