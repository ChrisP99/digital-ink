\chapter{CloudWatch}\label{ch:cloudwatch}

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observation tool which can provide developers with insights to monitor
applications, react to performance changes, and optimise resource consumption.
CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data about the application as logs and metrics to provide a
complete overview of operation health, resource consumption, and the services currently running on AWS\@.
This is useful for any cloud-based application as it allows developers to set alarms, visualise metric logs,
troubleshoot errors and, most importantly, identify and correct anomalous behaviour~\parencite{amazon2022amazon}.
An example of CloudWatch usage would be an alarm set to alert developers when a specified resource consumption level
is over a certain threshold.

For the purposes of the project, multiple CloudWatch alarms will be set up which will allow monitoring for budgeting
and performance across the various AWS services used.

The first alarm which will be set up is a network alarm.
This will allow for an email to be sent to the group in the event that the bandwidth of the EC2
