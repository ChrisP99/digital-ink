An SSL/TLS certificate could be added, as it was not possible to do this from within the lab tutorial due to a lack of permissions from the root AWS account.
By adding a certificate we would be able to encrypt the connections to our EC2 instance and increase the security of our application for all users.

We would like to add more roles and users to our IAM, but were limited by the amount that we were able to access.

If we were to do the project again, we would use AWS Elastic Beanstalk as it allows automatic orchestration of all the resources needed for a LAMP stack style application such as ours, it also has support for Docker which is a containerization technology that we had used in our application project.
