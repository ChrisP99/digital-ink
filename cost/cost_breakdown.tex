\chapter{Cost Breakdown}\label{ch:cost-breakdown}

If this web app was to be deployed to the public, or be expanded to a larger market, it would be important to
gather estimated costs for hosting the app in the cloud with all the AWS services being used.
The AWS Pricing Calculator can be used to calculate current costs and predict future costs.
To calculate these costs, it is required to specify every implemented feature and several projected inputs and outputs,
such as amount of data transferred on the app per month~\parencite{amazon2022aws}.
The monthly cost and a yearly cost of deploying the app in its current state was calculated first.
Following this, the calculator was used to predict monthly and yearly costs for scaling the deployment up to larger
user-bases.
These figures were calculated for scaling the app up to 10,000 users, one million users, and ten million users, which
would require upgrading some selected AWS features.
