In order to predict costs for the use of the AWS infrastructure, estimates from the official AWS
calculator were utilized. The AWS calculator required every implemented feature to be
inserted, as well as the projected inputs/outputs. E.g. how much data is transferred in a month.
The predicted monthly costs and yearly costs were output by the calculator given the present
state of the application on AWS. Following the initial prediction obtained from the AWS
calculator, those figures were used to create other scenarios for if the application gained 1000
to 10000000 users. The figures are used to estimate the costs when the application is scaled
up.
